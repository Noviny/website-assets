# website-assets

For use in the keystone docs site, these are being removed from the repo as storing images in a repo is unideal

Assets here are synced to S3 and then can be accessed at `https://keystonejs.s3.amazonaws.com/framework-assets/`

For example, accessing [assets/admin-ui.png](./assets/admin-ui.png), you can use the link [https://keystonejs.s3.amazonaws.com/framework-assets/assets/admin-ui.png](https://keystonejs.s3.amazonaws.com/framework-assets/assets/admin-ui.png)
